# Wired and Wrieless Networks
## Types of Network
There are two main types of networks. These are LANs (Local Area Networks) and WANs (Wide Area Networks)

### LANs
Local area networks are the type of network that you are likely to have in a home, office, or small bussiness.
A LAN is a network that is in one geographical location.

### WANs
WANs are big networks that span over two or more geographicaly remote locations.
This could just be two sites of a school, seperated by a road.

The Internet can be considered a WAN.

## What effects network performance?
Network speed can be affected by bandwidth.

Bandwidth is the maximum about of data that can be sent across the network at any given time.
If there are lots of people using the network, they have to share the bandwidth and this can cause a bottle neck (meaning that network will slow down).

## Client-Server and Peer-to-Peer Networks
### Client-Server netowkrs
In a Client-Server network, there are two types of node.
The server, and clients.
Clients connect to the server, and the server is the middle man in all other communication.
In a client-server netowrk, if the server is down (being updated / DDoSeD/ company goes bankruped) then no one can use the service.

### Peer-to-Peer networks
In a Peer-to-Peer (p2p) netowork, there is only one type of node.
Nodes communicate with each other directly, and don't go through a middle man.
This means that for what ever reason, if one node goes down, everythng still works.
It makes it difficult for any third-party to shut down the netork.
P2P networks can be described as being decentralized.

## Making a LAN
There are a few things that you need to setup a LAN.
These are as follows:
* Wireless Access Point
* Switches / Routers
* NIC (Network interface card)
* Transmition media

## So... What is the Internet?
An internet is just a publically accesable network of networks.
You may have head for an intranet.
This is just a priavte network.

**The Internet** is just the name we with the massive internet that you are using to view thses notes.

### DNS
A DNS (or domain name server) allows you to convert a domain name (e.g. example.com) into an IP address (e.g 93.184.216.34).
It is just like a phone book (like the yellow pages) for the internet.

### Hosts
A Host, simply put, is a computer that can be remotely accessed via a network (e.g. the internet).

### The Cloud
When you store files in the cloud, they are just stored in a concrete building somewhere. 
The cloud is just the name for remoetly accessable storage via a network.
